# full-stack-open-exe

This is an exercise repo for the fullstack course from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2023 which serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript.
The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.
The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.
